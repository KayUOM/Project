TODO:

1. Introduction
- What is the Problem
- Motivation For Project, why is it a problem
- Recent statistics on the number of cyber security threats
- Who is the audience ( beginners and advanced )
- whats included in the rest of this report 
 
2. Background
- Research Methods - how you will research
- how will you gather data
- analyse a case study (LinkedIn hack and others )
- why is securing web applications important


3. Research
what methods will you use to solve the problem


4. Aims and Objective
- Aim: Analyse Web Application Security (Cyber) Threats,
can machines predict if a piece of code is maliciou.
- List of Objectives to achieve this aim.
- Gannt Chart

- Research Methods
Process Flow
Tools

5. Ethics
- Why do we need to consider ethics ( ethics of hacking )
- Ethics of using and collecting the data

6. Evaluation
- What is the success criteria for the project (Does the algorithm 
successfully predict if code is malicious? 
- How will it be tested 

its proportional, we need to add a new scale param similr to b*f (a, the overall scale, base line distance). z = a / k+disparity. XY should be similar to Z
